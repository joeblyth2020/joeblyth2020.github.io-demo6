                 <h2>About Me</h2>
                  <p> 
                    I am Joseph Blythe a web designer, I love creating ideas of value that works for everyone involved. In 1994 I developed my first website in HTML and over the years I have developed many websites many were abandoned by the owners. <p> To me a website should be a valuable asset of information to be given to others to help them in life. Yes the site is new it is my own start-up I plan on being around for awhile. So with that said let me develop you a responsive very interactive website for your needs the price is what I advertise no hidden fees just develop it and you own it use it end of story.</p><p>Thanks for your interest, first please create a free account at www.jitsi.org. Second configure your info to fit your needs.</p> Third take a brief moment to educate your users. On to the next subject this is a site that Christians can use to have live prayer, chat and communicate without Social Media distractions and censoring. I highly recommend you the user to invest in a site like this for your own use, so that you have 100% control not “Big Tech”. I am a Web designer and I can put together a very interactive, engaging website. Any questions or inquires please email me at josephblythe@jblythescdev.live.
